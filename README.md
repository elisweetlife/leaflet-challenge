# leaflet-challenge
Mapping web Leaflet and APIs - Visualizing Data with Leaflet. 
Built a mapping tool in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet with an API connection to the USGS live GeoJSON feed in order to visualize earthquake data and correlate to issues that impact our planet. Developed mapping layers to distinguish occurrence with amplitude and date/time stamps. Learned how to layer different types of maps - satellite, grayscale, outdoors and also ability to toggle ON/OFF fault lines and earthquake responses.
